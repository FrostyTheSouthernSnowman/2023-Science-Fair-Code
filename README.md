## Utilizing Electromagnets for More Energy Efficient Manipulation of Metal Objects

In this project, we experimented with using electromagnets for more efficient movement of objects in space by building prototypes on Earth. Originally, we were planning to create a system with full three degrees of freedom control over any metalic object, however, we were not able to get past one dimension. Our current best is still a single electromagnet, with renders and desgns for one, two, and three degrees of freedom.

Code in the root directory is for generating data for the graphs (we were not able to measure most of this stuff) and the `graphs` directory contains code to create the graphs, using plotly, pandas, and python.

If you want to try it yourself, install python, plotly, and pandas, then run any of the generation scripts, wait a while, move the outputed csv file into the data directory (you will need to create that folder), and run your desired graph script.
